# DAHLIA-86
The DIRT-16 Advanced High-Level Instruction Assembler, or "DAHLIA" for brevity, is an assembler for the DIRT-16 fantasy computer. This project is the x86_64 version, though in Rust it should be portable to anywhere LLVM supports. In the future there will be a version of DAHLIA for the DIRT-16, though it seems likely that that will initially be assembled by this x86 version. Lower level details of DIRT-16 assembly and machine code will be documented in this README file.

## Usage
`DAHLIA [ASM file] -o [binary file]`
